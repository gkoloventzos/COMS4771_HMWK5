The problem described here is the famous Monty hall problem.
We will analyze the what happens when you choose the first door as
your choise. W.l.o.g. is the same if you choose any of the other 2 doors.
Let assume that the C$x$ event is that the car is behind door $x$.
So $P(Cx) = \frac{1}{3}$. Also let assume that user choosing door $x$ is D$x$.
Also host opening door $x$ is represented H$x$. Also $P(Cx\mid D1) = \frac{1}{3}$.
Also we have the probabilities:
\begin{align*}
P(H3\mid C1,D1) &= \frac{1}{2}\\
P(H3\mid C2,D1) &= 1\\
P(H3\mid C3,D1) &= 0
\end{align*}
Because if the car is in behind door 1 then the host can open any of the other 2.
If car is behind door 2 then he has to open the 3rd door. And it will not open the 
3rd door if the car is behind that door. So if the player select door 1 and the host
opens the 3rd, the probability of winning by switching is:
\begin{align*}
P(C2\mid H3,D1) &= \frac{P(H3\mid C2,D1) P(C2\mid D1)}{P(H3\mid D1)}\\
&= \frac{P(H3\mid C2,D1) P(C2\mid D1)}{P(H3\mid C1,D1) P(C1\mid D1) + P(H3\mid C2,D1) P(C2\mid D1) + P(H3\mid C3,D1) P(C3\mid D1)}\\
&= \frac{P(H3\mid C2,D1)}{P(H3\mid C1,D1) + P(H3\mid C2,D1) + P(H3\mid C3,D1)}\\
&= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} + 1 + 0} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}
So it is better to change doors.
