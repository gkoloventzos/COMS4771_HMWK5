The propability $p(x_1,\dotsc,x_5) = \prod_{i=i}^5 p(x_i\mid \pi_i)$.
So for our graph we have:
\begin{align*}
p(x_1,\dotsc,x_5) = p(x_1)p(x_3)p(x_2\mid x_1)p(x_4\mid x_{1},x_3)p(x_5\mid x_{2},x_4)
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}
\item False. As no node is shaded the ball can go from $x_2$ to $x_1$ and reach $x_4$ (2 effects handout 15 p.12)
\item False. As $x_5$ is shaded the ball can reach $x_4$ by this node.
\item True. The ball will bounce at $x_5$ and also will stop at $x_1$.
\item True. The ball can reach $x_5$ to $x_3$ through $x_2, x_1, x_4$.
\item False. With the addition of $x_2$ the previous path (4) is blocked.
\item True. The ball can reach $x_3$ by $x_1, x_2, x_5, x_4$.
\item False. The previous path (7) is blocked when $x_2$ is shaded.
\item False. The ball will bounce at $x_5$ and also at $x_4$. So $x_2 \independent x_3$. 
\item True. Because now the ball passes from $x_5$
\item True. Because now the ball passes from $x_5$
\end{enumerate}
